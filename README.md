# [ \ Simple Safety Guide / ]
A simple guide on the dangers of github. Rats and other malicious software have been an issue, so heres a guide.

--- "Theres an AI infestation in my house!" ---

Lets start with something simple... Bots. Simply search up roblox executor and set it to recently updated and you get... this:

Of course, these bots have the same template description and the SAME GOD DAMN ZIP FILE! Its always 'Software.zip' or 'Program.zip'
Some will even have botted stars so more people can find them. Bots are the least of our worries though.

--- "Nice try! This file is malicious!" ---

Now... Alot of people upload malicious software and pass it off as a genuine exe or cheat (roblox executors once again!) so it is important to note this... MOST 0 STAR EXECUTORS ARE MOST LIKELY VIRUSES! There are MANY type of viruses, like rats, stealers and etc... So how do you find these? Here are a few steps:

[Do this with care, one slip up and your device will be toast. Also remember to have some type of anti virus]

Step 1: https://www.uncoverit.org (keep this in a opened tab)

Step 2: Find a suspicious EXE and drag it to the upload button on the website.

Step 3: It should come back with results, either it shows what type of malicious software it is, or it will be a ???. Open up the config for a better look.

Step 4 (could happen): Now... What if you see something known as a "Discord Webhook" hmm? Well copy it and paste it into URL bar on your browser. If it has error 10015, it is deleted. If you see stuff like guild IDs and channel IDs... Refer to step 5.

Step 5: https://webhook-deleter.netlify.app (this tool is used for deleting malicious webhooks, simply paste the webhook into the bar and press delete and you just stopped a scam!)

Quick note: Stealers will mostly have webhooks. Another tool you can use when finding a malicious webhook is this: https://discohook.org (this can be used to control the bot and to troll the scammers before deleting it, always remember to spam @everyone!)

Some examples of Uncoverit.org working:

--- "Uncoverit came back with a ??? so what do I do!" ---

So... What if uncoverit came back with a ??? you may wonder... Use a VM and use necessary steps to keep the VM safe and contained to lower the already low odds of the malicious file passing through the VM and into your main PC. Or you could use https://tria.ge as it gives more info as to what is going on behind the scenes once you finish the sandbox and all that.

Example of Tria.ge working:

[HALL OF SHAME!]

Ah... Now here are some virus creators. Some even had viruses with webhooks that I gladly destroyed. Make sure to stay away from people like these:

Oh yea... And now that this is done with... PROMO TIME!

YEAAAAAAA! Anyways, this was the simple guide. Do more research though just to be safe as I havent even scratched the surface of the potential risks of Github files. Stay safe.
